BitcoinMoney Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
BitcoinMoney Core is the original BitcoinMoney client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of BitcoinMoney transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download BitcoinMoney Core, visit [bitcoinmoney.org](https://bitcoinmoney.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run BitcoinMoney on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitcoinmoney-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bitcoinmoneyd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitcoinmoney-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag BitcoinMoney-Core to your applications folder, and then run BitcoinMoney-Core.
